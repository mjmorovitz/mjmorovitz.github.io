This is my personal webpage containing personal information for job applications. The projet contains three pages: the homepage, my biography, and my resume. Additionally there is a link to my LinkedIn page and a pdf version of my resume.

All parts of the project have met project requirements including passing official CSS validation via http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ and official HTML5 specifications via http://validator.w3.org/. 

All parts of the project were done using only CSS and HTML, no frameworks. Depending screen size and resolution, format may appear off for some computers/browsers. This is especially appearant on the resume html page. The format should be experiences on the left hand side of the screen adn all other catergories lining up next to it on the right. If the items appear jumbles please increase expand window width to view properly.

Advice for this project was given by former comp 20 student Ariel Luque and TA George Brown. Additional resources used include http://www.w3schools.com, stackoverflow.com, & codeacademy.com.  

The project was completed over the span of two weeks and took approximately 15 hours. Much of the inital time spent was in learning HTML and CSS. At least 5 additional hours were spent on adjusting objects for changing screen sizes.
