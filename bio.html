<div id="bio">
<p>My name is Maretta Morovitz and I am a Computer Science major in the Tufts University School of Engineering. In addition to being a fulltime student, I am also a Research Assistant at the Tufts Human-Robot Interaction Lab. In this capacity I have designed and implemented research studies, operated and programmed features for robots including the PR2 (Willow Garage), the MDS (Xitome Designs), and the Nao (Aldebaran Robotics), and coded data analysis programs. Additionally, I am a co-author on a paper accepted to a workshop at the 2015 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction entitled, Do teleoperated androids take tele-embodiment too far?. For the past two summers I have worked as an intern at the MITRE Corporation in the Department of Agile and Adaptive Software Engineering. Through this position I have gained skills programming, research, employing agile methodologies, and project management.  I am involved in the Computer Science Department through my membership in the Tufts Computer Science Exchange (CSX). Through this organization I have expanded my computer science skills by participating in nontraditional courses on topics such as using Git and GitHub. I am active on the Tufts campus through my participation in Tufts Equestrian Team, Tufts Mixed Martial Arts, the Interfaith Student Council and the Catholic Community at Tufts. Outside of my college community I train weekly in Kenpo Karate at Dynamic Martial Arts where I currently hold the rank of Black Belt. I believe that these experiences have, not only increased my skills in computer science, but also taught me to be responsible for large projects, made me self-dependent, and given me the skills necessary to complete work in a timely manner. Both my technical and nontechnical experiences have taught me valuable leadership and teamwork skills that are essential in the workplace.</p>
