<p>My name is Maretta Morovitz and I am a Computer Science major in the Tufts University School of Engineering. In addition to being a fulltime student, I am also the Head Research Assistant at the Tufts Human-Robot Interaction Lab.In this capacity I have designed and implemented research studies, operated and programmed features for robots including the PR2 (Willow Garage), the MDS (Xitome Designs), and the Nao (Alderbran Robotics), and coded data anlysis programs. As a result of this work, I am second author on two papers to be submitted for review for the HRI 2015 Conference. Additionally, I am involved in the Computer Science Department through my membership in the Tufts Computer Science Exchange (CSX). Through this organization I have expanded my computer science skills by participating in nontraditional courses on topics such as using git and GitHub.I am active on the Tufts campus through my participation in the Tufs Equestrian Team, Tufts Mixed Martial Arts, and the Catholic Community at Tufts. Outside of my college community I train weekly in Kenpo Karate at Dyanamic Martial Arts where I currently hold the rank of Black Belt. I believe that these experiences have increased my skills in computer science, as well as taught responsible for large projects, to be self-dependent, to complete work in a timely manner, and to take full advantage of all resources I have at my disposal. Both my technical and nontechnical experiences have taught me no only valuable leadership skills, but also important teamwork skills that will be essential in the workplace.</p>
